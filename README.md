# Project Setup Instructions

Thank you for pulling the project! Below are the steps to install Node.js, npm, and set up the React Vite project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: Download and install from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm**: This should be installed with Node.js. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   npm --version


## Installation

Install my-project with npm

Step 1: Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
  cd your-repo
```

Step 2: Install project dependencies

To install all the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
  npm install
```

This will install everything listed in the package.json file.


Step 3: Run the project

To start the Vite development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will run the React app locally. Once started, you can open your browser and go to:

```arduino
http://localhost:5173
```

Step 4: Building for Production

If you want to build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
  npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build of your React application in the dist/ directory.


Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup, try the following:

 > Make sure your Node.js and npm versions are up-to-date.
 > Try deleting node_modules and package-lock.json and           reinstalling  dependencies with:

 ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
```

Feel free to open an issue if you run into any further problems!
